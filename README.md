## NASA's Mission
NASA's Pscyhe Space Mission involves a journey to a unique metal-rich asteroid, named Psyche, that is located between Mars and Jupiter.
Scientists think that the Psyche asteroid might be "building block of an early planet" (NASA, 2025)​. 
The goal of the mission is to orbit the asteroid and take pictures of and collect data to learn more about its composition.

## Our Mission
The goal of our project was to create two educational AR/XR experiences for visitors of the Psyche showcase. We wanted the experiences
to be fun and engaging for a diverse audience of different ages and educational levels.

### Interactive Psyche Model:
Our first scene shows off a 3D model that we developed to replicate the Psyche Satellite. Each instrument was modeled carefully, and it is fully interactable!
Users can place the model in any flat space using their phone cameras and they can rotate or walk around the model. When clicking on each of
the different instruments, an pop up displays relevant information about the selected instrument. 

### Solar System Simulation:
The second experience displays an accurate, to scale, model of the solar system. Each of the planets are modeled with accurate masses
and gravitational weights. They orbit around the sun, and so does the Psyche asteroid! Users are able
